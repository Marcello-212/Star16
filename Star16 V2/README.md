# Star16 V2 # 
  This is the next version of the Star16 computer!
## The specs ##
  The specs are the same... except now there are jumps. (Conditionals included!)
## Assembly ##
  Assembly got an upgrade!
  * LDI: Loads a value into one of the registers.
  * ADD/SUB/MULT/DIV: Do the same as before: do their operation on the first two registers and store the result in the last register.
  * JMP: Jumps to the specified address.
  * JNN: Jumps if a condition is true. All of these have got checking by comparing 2 registers. NN can be: EQ, NE, GT, LT, GE or LE.
  * HALT: Halts the processor instantly.
